# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

This project read an input file which contained a list of items purchased from a grocery store. It then, through integrating both Python and C++ languages, displayed a menu from which the user could select an option, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Option 1 displayed the frequency of the number of times each item in the grocery list occurred. Option 2 displayed the frequency of the number of times a specific item in the grocery list occurred. Option 3 displayed a histogram based on the frequency of the number of times each grocery item occurred. And option 4 let the user exit the program. The problem it was solving was to parse through an input file and the calculate and display the frequency of each grocery item in said input file.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well in utilizing methods and functions in both Python and C++ in order to compartmentalize the code and make it more readable and tidy. I also think I did well in getting both programming languages to work together, in so far as, the C++ side of the program handled the UI and display interfaces, while the Python aspect of the program handled parsing through the input file and creating the output file that then allowed for the display of the histogram.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could do better in handling for more exceptions to improve the security and functionality of it. I'm sure there are a few instances where input from the user may result in the program crashing or an unhandled exception being thrown.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the most challenging part of the code to write was the Python functions, simply because it has been a while since I have worked with Python. I needed a bit of a refresher when it comes to syntax and structure of the language, so to overcome this I simply utilized the resources provided to me in the Zybooks learning modules to give myself a bit of a refresher course on Python. However, once I started to get the hang of it the coding of the program went smoother.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think the problem solving skills required to complete a project like this are invaluable and translate to an infinite number of real world practical applications and job settings/scenarios. I also think being able to work independently and solve problems on your own and as you encounter them is a valuable skill and trait to have; as well as being stubborn and meticulous enough to continue to work on the project even when you encounter such difficulties and problems.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In order to make this program more readable I included a description of the programs intended functionalities at the beginning of the code and tried to include as detailed of inline comments as I could to portions of the code where it may otherwise be ambiguous as the reasoning and function behind it. To make the code more maintable and adaptable I included if statements to handle invalid input from the user, so that the program does not just throw a random error code or crash altogether if it encounters invalid input. Also through using functions and methods, and compartmentalizing the code in this way, it makes a lot of the code transferrable to future projects and more easily maintainable.
